# Dashboard Card Snippet Library
# ================================
#
# This folder contains "known good" YAML snippets for dashboard cards.
# These are extracted from your production dashboards and can be
# copy-pasted into the HA UI card editor (Manual/YAML mode).
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. Open dashboard in HA
# 2. Edit view → Add Card → Manual
# 3. Copy snippet from this library
# 4. Paste into card editor
# 5. Adjust entity IDs if needed
# 6. Save

# NOTES:
# - grid_options vs layout_options: Both work, grid_options is newer
# - Color templates use Jinja2: {% if %}...{% endif %}
# - Some cards use tap_action for more-info popups
# - Multi-card sections stored as YAML arrays (billing folder)
